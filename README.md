## Rationale

Some tags and consequently posts have lower traffic and therefore
are not as heavily moderated. This bot is designed with a goal of
uncovering unanswered questions that are at least a day old and 
running filters to ensure they are still properly moderated.

As a consequence, the bot is designed not to report back posts
which already have close votes, as they will be in the Close Votes
Review Queue.

The bot is still in a very early stage of development. For any concerns
or suggestions, feel free to message @Papershine on Stack Overflow.

This is my personal project, and is not affiliated with Stack Overflow 
in any way.
